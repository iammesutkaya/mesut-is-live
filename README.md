This bot automatically monitors a specified Twitch stream, creates and flairs a dedicated live discussion thread when the stream goes live, updates the stats (viewers, uptime, category) in real-time every 2 minutes, auto-pins a customizable moderator comment, and unpins/concludes the thread with VOD archives when the stream goes offline.

## ✨ Core Features

**🔴 Automatic Live Threads**  
Periodically polls your Twitch stream (every 2 minutes) and posts a beautifully stickied live discussion thread when you go live.

---

**⚡ Real-Time Statistics**  
Keeps the post body up-to-date in real-time with current uptime, game/category, and live viewer count.

---

**🛡️ Flapping & Disconnect Protection (6-Min Grace Period)**  
Prevents duplicate thread spam if your stream crashes briefly, OBS restarts, or Twitch’s API has a hiccup. It buffers the offline status for 6 minutes before concluding the thread.

---

**📺 Dual-Platform Promotion**  
Optionally promotes your YouTube stream alongside Twitch. If configured, links to both platforms are displayed side-by-side in both live and concluding posts.

---

**🏷️ Custom Post Flairing**  
Automatically flairs the live post (e.g., "🔴 Live Now") using your subreddit's custom post flair templates.

---

**📌 Pinned Moderator Comments**  
Auto-posts a distinguished, stickied moderator comment at the top of the discussion section to drive users to your Discord, social media, or list rules.

---

**🏁 Concluding VOD Archives**  
When the stream goes offline for more than 6 minutes, the bot edits the post to a clean "Offline / Thanks for watching!" archive state, highlights VOD links, locks the post to prevent late spam, and unstickies it.

---

**💬 Auto-Suggested Comment Sort**  
Automatically sets the suggested comment sort of the live post to "New" so the comment section behaves like a real-time stream chat.

---

**🎥 Stream Highlights Post**  
Queries Twitch Helix Clips API upon stream conclusion to automatically compile the top 5 clips generated during that stream and submit them as a standalone highlights thread.

---

**🚀 Efficient Redis Caching**  
Caches Twitch OAuth credentials for 24 hours to ensure high speed and prevent rate-limiting.

---

**🛠️ Unified Admin Reset**  
Includes a single-click moderator action in your subreddit mod tools to reset the scheduler and clear the cached database state instantly.

## 🔑 How to Get Twitch Credentials

To configure the bot, you need a **Twitch Client ID** and **Twitch Client Secret** so the bot can securely request live status updates from Twitch's API:

1. Go to the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and log in with your Twitch account.
2. Click **Register Your Application** (or navigate to **Applications** ➔ **Register Your Application**).
3. Fill in the registration form:
   * **Name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., `Subreddit-Stream-Notifier-Bot`).
   * **OAuth Redirect URLs**: Enter `http://localhost` (a placeholder is fine; the bot uses the secure Client Credentials flow and does not need a redirect web page).
   * **Category**: Select **Application Integration** or **Chat Bot**.
4. Click **Create**.
5. Find your newly created application and click **Manage**:
   * Copy the **Client ID** and paste it into the bot settings.
   * Click **New Secret** to generate a secret. Copy the **Client Secret** and paste it into the bot settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never share your Client Secret. Reddit securely encrypts this secret so it is never exposed to regular users or shown in plain text on the page once saved.

## 🌐 Fetch Domains

This app makes HTTP requests to the following external domains (declared in [`devvit.json`](./devvit.json)):

| Domain | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id.twitch.tv` | Twitch OAuth 2.0 token endpoint. Used to obtain a short-lived App Access Token via the Client Credentials flow, which is required to authenticate all Twitch Helix API requests. |
| `api.twitch.tv` | Twitch Helix REST API. Used to poll the live status of the configured channel (`/streams`), fetch stream metadata (title, game, viewer count), and retrieve top clips (`/clips`) for the post-stream highlights post. |

No user data is sent to these external services. Only the bot's own Client ID and Client Secret (configured by the moderator) are used for authentication.
